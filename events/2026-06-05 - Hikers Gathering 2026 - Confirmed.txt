Hikers Gathering 2026 — Confirmed! 

We have secured the Grouse Group Campground. You are welcome to confirm your presence up to the last minute if you would like to join us. 

📅 Event Dates:
June 5th & 6th, 2026 (two nights)

🏕️ What This Event Is All About

Each year, we reserve a massive group campground in Bow Valley Provincial Park, split the cost, and create our own little weekend hiking village.

Daytime is completely free-form—choose your own adventures, hikes, lazy mornings, or explorations.
Evenings? That’s when the magic happens. We all gather around a roaring communal campfire for stories, laughter, and reconnecting under the stars.

Not camping?
No problem! You’re still welcome to join the fire on Friday and/or Saturday night.

💰 Cost
The park charges per sleeping unit (tent, RV, trailer, etc.), not per person.
• Regular sleeping unit — $67 (for both nights)
• Car Sleepers — $20 (for both nights) - If you sleep in a non–sleeping-unit vehicle (e.g., van/SUV), the park doesn’t charge, but we’ll use these contributions to keep things fair and help offset costs for sleeping-unit folks.

📬 Interested?

Send me a message and I’ll add you to the group chat.
