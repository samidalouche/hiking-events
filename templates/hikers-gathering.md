Hikers Gathering 2026 — Early Bird Spots Now Open! 

It’s that time of year again! To lock in our beloved Grouse Group Campground for 2026, I need our Early Birds to help secure 10 sleeping units.
If you already know you’re in, please send your payment by November 30th to snag the early-bird rate.

📅 Event Dates:
June 5th & 6th, 2026 (two nights)

🏕️ What This Event Is All About

Each year, we reserve a massive group campground in Bow Valley Provincial Park, split the cost, and create our own little weekend hiking village.

Daytime is completely free-form—choose your own adventures, hikes, lazy mornings, or explorations.
Evenings? That’s when the magic happens. We all gather around a roaring communal campfire for stories, laughter, and reconnecting under the stars.

Not camping?
No problem! You’re still welcome to join the fire on Friday and/or Saturday night.

💰 Cost
The park charges per sleeping unit (tent, RV, trailer, etc.), not per person.
• Early Birds — $60 (for both nights) - Send payment before Nov 30th to be part of the first 10 units (This discounted price is thanks to leftover funds from last year!).
• Butterflies — $67 (for both nights) - For those who join later. We can add you right up until the last minute.
• Car Sleepers — $20 (for both nights) - If you sleep in a non–sleeping-unit vehicle (e.g., van/SUV), the park doesn’t charge, but we’ll use these contributions to keep things fair and help offset costs for sleeping-unit folks.

📬 Interested?

Send me a message and I’ll add you to the group chat.

Le Hikers Gathering 2026 aura lieu le weekend du 5-7 juin (nuits du 5 et 6 juin).

Le jour ? Entièrement libre : à vous de choisir vos aventures, randonnées, matinées tranquilles ou explorations.
Le soir ? C’est là que la magie opère. Nous nous retrouvons tous autour d’un grand feu de camp commun pour partager des histoires, rire et nous reconnecter sous les étoiles.

Pas envie de camper ?
Pas de souci ! Vous êtes tout de même les bienvenus autour du feu le vendredi et/ou le samedi soir.
