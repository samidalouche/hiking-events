## Group Post

Are there people interested in camping and hiking in this group?

Each year, we reserve a massive group campground in Bow Valley Provincial Park, split the cost, and create our own little weekend hiking village.

Daytime is completely free-form—choose your own adventures, hikes, lazy mornings, or explorations.
Evenings? That’s when the magic happens. We all gather around a roaring communal campfire for stories, laughter, and reconnecting under the stars.

📅 Event Dates:
June 5th & 6th, 2026 (two nights)

I need our Early Birds to help secure 10 sleeping units, so please let me know if you're interested.

Hello everyone! 

I hope you had a good Fall so far.

It’s that time of year again! To lock in our beloved Grouse Group Campground for 2026, I need our Early Birds to help secure 10 sleeping units.

If you already know you’re in, please send $60 to sami.dalouche@gmail.com by November 30th.
If you're not sure yet, let me know you want to be a butterfly and I'll add you to the butterfly chat to remind you closer to the event date.

📅 Event Dates:
June 5th & 6th, 2026 (two nights)
