⛺️ It’s that time of year again… Summer 2026 camping reservations launch in January! 🚀

I’m already sketching out my summer adventure plans, and if you’ve been thinking about joining a multi-day camping or hut trip, this is your sign 👀

I put together a quick overview of what to expect on these trips: logistics, vibes, and all the good stuff, so you know exactly what you’re signing up for:

If any of this sounds fun, hit me up or drop a comment—always happy to have more trail and/or camping companions 🌄
